There are sql diff files provided for you to alter database schemes from
versions.  If you are currently running an unstable release, results may
be unpreditable.

example:

to update tables from version 0.4.2 to 0.5.0:
mysql> mysql -u USERNAME -p DATABASE < 0.4.2-0.5.0.sql;


You will want to go through the admin configuration pages once you've
upgraded to ensure all settings are intact.  Depending upon the database
schema changes between versions, you risk losing these settings when you 
upgrade. This script is too help preserve the story/comment data specifically.
