<h3 align="center">Or,</h3>
<h2 align="center">"This icon says more about me than
it does about my web page"</h2>

This page is my best effort to convince you, the web page author,
<strong>not</strong> to use an under construction icon on your page.
The whole idea of the web as a place which is "under construction" is
getting very old.  

<p>

Don't believe me?  Try this simple exercise.  Face away from your
computer, clear your mind, and slowly, carefully ask yourself the
following question:

<blockquote>
"What does editing HTML files have in common with shovels, hard hats,
big trucks, and construction work?
</blockquote>

Hmmm... <strong>Nothing</strong>?  That's right!  Good, good!  Now try
this one:

<blockquote>
If writing a simple web page is so difficult for me that I
compare it to doing hard manual labor, does that mean I'm a nitwit?
</blockquote>

Well, <strong>yes</strong>, I'm afraid it does!  See, with just a
little thinking, you realize that the imagery of "under construction"
icons on web pages is just some cute little joke which has, for no
good reason, gone <strong>completely</strong> out of control.  Time to
quit it.

<p>

Now if, for some very unfortunate reason, you <strong>must</strong>
put an under construction icon on the page you're writing (for instance, your
boss will fire you if you don't), may I humbly suggest one of my
alternative "under construction" icons:

<p>

we will all know exactly what kind of message you're trying to

I have high standards for my work.  So high, in fact, that no matter
how much I work on this page, I'm never quite happy with it.  Like
everyone else, I resort to using an under construction icon.  But
you can bet your socks that my icon looks fancier and shinier than
your icon!
