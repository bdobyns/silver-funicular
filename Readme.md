best practices and basics for starting projects


* `php-eb-simple` a trivial php app deployable with elastic beanstalk
   * including instructions for a tech lead to set a new one up
   * instructions for developers to join the project
   * a working `deploy.sh` showing the common verbs and some project-specific verbs
* `php-eb-wordpress` a php app with a MySQL database
   * mysql is deployed with elastic beanstalk
   * wordpress has `bad hygiene` and writes files back into the local filesystem
